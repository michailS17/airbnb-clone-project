# airbnb-clone-project

The backend for the Airbnb Clone project is designed to provide a robust and scalable foundation for managing user interactions, property listings, bookings, and payments. This backend will support various functionalities required to mimic the core features of Airbnb, ensuring a smooth experience for users and hosts.

# team-roles

QA Engineer: Ensures the backend functionalities are thoroughly tested and meet quality standards.

# Technology Stack

Django: A high-level Python web framework used for building the RESTful API.
Django REST Framework: Provides tools for creating and managing RESTful APIs.
PostgreSQL: A powerful relational database used for data storage.
GraphQL: Allows for flexible and efficient querying of data.
Celery: For handling asynchronous tasks such as sending notifications or processing payments.
Redis: Used for caching and session management.
Docker: Containerization tool for consistent development and deployment environments.
CI/CD Pipelines: Automated pipelines for testing and deploying code changes.

# Database Design
1. User
Represents both guests and hosts.
id (Primary Key): Unique identifier.
username or email: Used for login.
password: Hashed, for authentication.
is_host: Boolean flag to distinguish host from guest.
created_at: Timestamp of registration.
Relationships:
A user can own multiple properties.
A user can make multiple bookings.
A user can write multiple reviews.

2. Property
Represents a house, apartment, or space listed for rent.
Important Fields:
id: Unique identifier.
owner (ForeignKey to User): The host who listed the property.
title: Name of the listing.
description: Detailed info about the property.
location: City or address.
price_per_night: Rental cost.
Relationships:
Belongs to one host (User).
Can have many bookings.
Can have many reviews.

3. Booking
Represents a reservation of a property by a user.
Important Fields:
id: Unique identifier.
user (ForeignKey to User): Who booked the property.
property (ForeignKey to Property): Which property is booked.
start_date: Check-in date.
end_date: Check-out date.
status: Enum or string (e.g confirmed, cancelled).
Relationships:
Belongs to one user.
Belongs to one property.
Has one payment (optional if pre-paid).

4. Payment
Handles financial transactions for bookings.
Important Fields:
id: Unique identifier.
booking (OneToOneField to Booking): Payment for a specific booking.
amount: Amount paid.
status: Enum (success, pending, failed).
transaction_id: Unique transaction code from payment gateway (e.g. Chapa).
Relationships:
Linked to one booking.
A booking has only one payment (OneToOne).

6. Review
Allows users to review a property after a stay.
Important Fields:
id: Unique identifier.
user (ForeignKey to User): Who wrote the review.
property (ForeignKey to Property): The reviewed property.
rating: Integer (e.g 1 to 5).
comment: Text review.
created_at: Timestamp.
Relationships:
Belongs to one user.
Belongs to one property.

# Feature Breakdown

1. User Management
Handles user registration, authentication, and profile updates.
It ensures secure access by validating user credentials allowing users to manage their personal data and view their interactions (bookings, listings, reviews).
2. Property Management
Enables hosts to create, update, and delete property listings.
Each property includes essential details like location, pricing, and description, making it discoverable to potential guests for booking.
3. Booking System
Allows users to reserve available properties for specific dates.
4. Payment Processing
This feature ensures that financial details are handled safely, allowing users to complete payments and store records of successful transactions.It handles booking creation, updates, and tracks details like check-in/check-out dates and booking status, forming the core of the reservation process.
5. Review System
Lets users post feedback and ratings on properties after their stay.
Reviews enhance trust and transparency, helping future guests make informed decisions and encouraging hosts to maintain high standards.
6. Data Optimization
Implements database indexing and caching strategies to boost performance.
These enhancements ensure faster API responses, scalable querying, and reduced server load under high user activity.
7. API Documentation
Uses OpenAPI and GraphQL to provide clear, interactive documentation for the backend endpoints.
This helps frontend developers, third-party integrators, and QA teams to understand and test the API efficiently.

# API Security
key security measures that will be implemented
1. Authentication
Verifies the identity of users via login credentials (email + password).
This prevents unauthorized access to personal accounts, ensuring only registered users can make bookings, list properties, or manage payments.
2. Authorization
Controls what an authenticated user is allowed to do (e.g. only property owners can edit their own listings).
Ensures users cannot access or modify data they do not own (e.g. booking someone else property).
3.Input Validation & Sanitization
Ensures user inputs (like names, emails, reviews) are safe and correctly formatted.
Why it matters: Defends against attacks like SQL injection, XSS (cross-site scripting), and malformed data that can crash or exploit the system.
4. Rate Limiting & Throttling
Limits the number of API requests a user or IP can make within a certain time.
Prevents brute force login attacks and protects the backend from being overwhelmed (DoS/DDoS attacks).
5. Data Encryption
Encrypts sensitive data in transit (via HTTPS) and optionally at rest (e.g., passwords with hashing, tokens).
Prevents attackers from reading private user info or intercepting communications.

# CI/CD Pipeline
CI/CD stands for Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment/Delivery. Itâ€™s a development workflow that automatically builds, tests, and deploys your code whenever you make changes (e.g pushing to GitHub).

Why CI/CD Is Important for This Project
Faster Development: Every time you push code, tests run automatically and changes can be deployed to staging or production without manual steps.
Fewer Bugs: Automated testing ensures that broken code is caught early, improving code quality.
Smooth Deployment: CI/CD ensures consistent, repeatable deployments, reducing errors and downtime.
Team Collaboration: Developers can work together efficiently, with each change validated and merged seamlessly.

Tools	Purpose
GitHub Actions	-Automate testing and deployment directly from GitHub
Docker	-Package your app in containers for consistent environments
